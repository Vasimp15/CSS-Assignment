1	Explain the difference between inline, internal, and external CSS. 
a.Inline CSS
Definition: CSS styles are applied directly to an individual HTML element using the style attribute.
Advantages:
* Quick and easy for small changes or testing.
* Styles apply only to the specific element, which reduces the risk of unintended side effects.
Disadvantages:
* Difficult to maintain and update for larger projects.
* Repetitive, as styles need to be rewritten for each element.
* Poor separation of content and design.

b. Internal CSS
Definition: CSS rules are placed within a <style> tag in the <head> section of an HTML document. These styles apply to elements within the same document.
Advantages:
* Useful for styling a single HTML document.
* Allows for better organization compared to inline CSS.
* Styles are applied to multiple elements in the same document using selectors.
Disadvantages:
* Not reusable across multiple HTML files.
* Can make the HTML document bulky.

c. External CSS
Definition: CSS is written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML document using a <link> tag in the <head>section.

Advantages:
* Reusable across multiple HTML files, reducing redundancy.
* Promotes better separation of content (HTML) and design (CSS).
* Easier to maintain and update styles for large projects.
Disadvantages:
* Requires an additional HTTP request to fetch the CSS file.
* Styles won’t be applied if the CSS file is unavailable or not loaded correctly.

2.Describe CSS selectors and list the types of selectors (e.g., element, class, id). 


CSS Selectors:
CSS selectors are patterns used to select and apply styles to specific HTML elements on a webpage. They define which elements a style rule should apply to. By combining different types of selectors, you can target elements with precision.

Types of CSS Selectors
Here’s a list of commonly used CSS selectors and their descriptions:

1. Universal Selector
* Description: Selects all elements on a page.
* Syntax: *
* 
* 2. Element (Type) Selector
* Description: Selects all elements of a specific type (e.g., all <p> or <h1> elements).
* Syntax: element

3. Class Selector
* Description: Selects all elements with a specific class attribute. A class can be used for multiple elements.
* Syntax: .className

4. ID Selector
* Description: Selects an element with a specific id attribute. IDs are unique and should only be used once per page.


3.Discuss the CSS box model and its components. 

The CSS box model is a fundamental concept that describes how every HTML element is rendered as a rectangular box on the web. It defines the structure and spacing around elements and determines how content, padding, borders, and margins interact.
The box model consists of the following components (from the innermost to the outermost):

1. Content
* Description: The area where text, images, or other content is displayed.
* Properties:
    * Dimensions of the content can be controlled using width and height.

2. Padding
* Description: The space between the content and the element's border.
* Key Points:
    * Adds inner spacing around the content.
    * Background color (if applied) extends into the padding area.
* Properties:
    * padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, padding-left (or shorthand padding).

3. Border
* Description: A line that wraps around the padding and content.
* Key Points:
    * Separates the padding from the margin.
    * Can be styled using border-width, border-style, and border-color (or shorthand border).
4. Margin
* Description: The outermost space around the element that separates it from other elements.
* Key Points:
    * Creates space between elements on the page.
    * Margins are transparent and do not have a background color.
    * Margins can collapse in certain situations (e.g., vertical margins of adjacent elements).
